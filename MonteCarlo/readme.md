For this in-class activity, choose one of the following input files for gcmc in LAMMPS:

1) in.gcmc.h2o
2) in.gcmc.c02
3) in.gcmc.lj


modify the input file to print to file the following items:

1) coordinates after the gcmc has run
2) radial distribution function from the run (for this you may need to increase the number of steps to get decent statistics)
3) some other plot of properties (like the rho vs. P data we looked at in class)
